# VerDocs

## Overview

Here, you will find software guides, FAQ's, etc...

## Maintenance

If you have access to Vernalis GitLab, then you can update these documents yourself by clicking the 'Edit this page on GitHub' link on the right.
Updating the markdown in the GitLab repo will trigger the site to rebuild with the updated document. Version control is built into GitLab, so there is no need to worry if you make a mistake!

If you are not comfortable making updates in markdown, then feel free to contact IT Requests and we will handle that for you.
